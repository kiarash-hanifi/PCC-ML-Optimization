# A Novel Workflow for Multi-objective Optimization of the Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) 
This repository contains the datasets and computational workflows developed for the manuscript “Multi-Objective Optimization of the Amine-Based Post-Combustion Carbon Capture Process Using Machine Learning Surrogate Modeling”, currently under review at Energy.

The repository is intended to support transparency and reproducibility. Detailed explanations and methodological descriptions will be updated after publication.
